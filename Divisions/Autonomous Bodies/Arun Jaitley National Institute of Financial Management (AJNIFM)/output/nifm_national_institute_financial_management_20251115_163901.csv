Autonomous Body,National Instituteof Financial Management,Paragraph,Paragraph 1,"The National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM) was set up in 1993 as a training institution for officers recruited by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) through the annual Civil Service Examinations and allocated to the various services responsible for managing senior and top management posts dealing with accounts and finance in the Government of India. NIFM was to develop as a Centre of Excellencein the areas of Financial Management and related disciplines, not only in India but also in Asia. In order to ensure that NIFM enjoys a greater degree of flexibility and autonomy than the departmental academies that existed at that time for officers training, it was decided that the Institute would be a legal entity known as ‘Society’. Such societies are legally independent entities authorized to frame their own rules and regulations. This structure makes available greater autonomy in both academic and administration matters to the Institute, facilitating quick decision making in response to changing perceptions of desired goals and objectives.",https://doe.gov.in/national-instituteof-financial-management,,,,

It will thus be seen that the Institute has close links and direct access to Government of India.

The Institute therefore has a distinct advantage of a mix of faculty from academic as well as Government sector.
